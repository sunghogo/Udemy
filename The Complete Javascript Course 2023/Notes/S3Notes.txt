L32 Activating Strict Mode
    Activate strict mode to write more secure JS code by writing this string at the beginning:
    'use strict'; 

    This string has to be the very first statement otherwise it will not be activated; comments are allowed

    We can also activate strict mode for a specific block or function

    Strict mode forbids us to do certain things, and will create visible errors in certain situations leading to more secure code
