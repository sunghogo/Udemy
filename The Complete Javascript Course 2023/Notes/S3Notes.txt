L32 Activating Strict Mode
    Activate strict mode to write more secure JS code by writing this string at the beginning:
    'use strict'; 

    This string has to be the very first statement otherwise it will not be activated; comments are allowed

    We can also activate strict mode for a specific block or function

    Strict mode forbids us to do certain things, and will create visible errors in certain situations leading to more secure code

    Checks for variable definitions

    Prevents short list of variable names that are reserved for features that may be added to the language later; Similar to prventing the use of keywords as variable names


L33 Functions
    Function is reusable chunks of code that allows us to write more maintainable code; like variables but for whole blocks of code

    Variables hold a value, functions hold one or more complete lines of code

    'function' keyword

    function name(inputs) {
        "function body"
    }

    Using/Executing the function is also called invoking, running, or calling the function

    We can pass and return data to/from a function

    Parameters are like input variables that are specific only to this function, and are defined once the function is called

    'return' keyword to return values from the function that we can store in variables

    When invoking a function, we pass in real values that will be assigned to the parameters, which are called the arguments of a function

    Specifying arguments or writing functions that are not called will not be executed

    Functions that do not return a value will return a 'undefined' value

    Clean Code: DRY Principle - Don't Repeat Yourself

    console.log(), Number(), String() are built-in functions

    Once again, you can type variable names in the developer console to see their values


L34 Function Declarations vs. Expressions
    Function declarations using the function keyword and a name

    Function expressions are using the function keyword without a name, also called an "anonymous function" 

    Parameters are like the placeholders for the inputs of a function, while the arguments are the actual values

    You can store functions in a variable as they are expressions that produce a value; you can then call the function using the variable name

    The main difference between function declarations and expressions is that you can call function declarations before they are defined in the code but not with expressions - this is due to a process called hoisting

    Both have their uses, and based on developer's preference


L35 Arrow Functions
    Arrow function is a special form function expression that is shorter and faster to write

    parameter => "Function Body"

    No need for curly braces and return happens implicitly; excellent for simple one liners

    For more than one lines, need curly braces and explicit return statement for that block

    For more than one arguments, need parteneses around the arguments

    Arrow functions lose their advantage in longer functions

    Arrow functions do not get a so called 'this' keyword

    In VSCode, to wrap word in parentheses/other characters:
    Select word, () / ' / " / {} / etc.

    In VSCode, shortcut to scroll to beginning/end line:
    CTRL + home/end

    In VSCode, shortcut to switch tabs:
    CTRL + pg up/ pg dn


L36 Functions Calling Other Functions
    Functions can call other functions, which is useful for the DRY principle and cleaner/maintainable code

    Function Data/Control Flow for example: 
    2 is passed to apples paramenter of fruitProcessor(), which is then passed to fruit paramenter of cutFruitPieces(), and stored in variable applePieces

    Similarly, 3 is passed to oranges of both parameters, and stored into variable orangePieces

    In VSCode, shortcut to go to line:
    CTRL + G, input line number


L37 Reviewing Functions
    Two functions can have the same parameter names because they are not related/in scope of each other (similar to local variables)

    Similarly paramenter can have the same name as a declared variable as they are NOT related

    Functions are NOT TYPED, can return values of different types

    Once a function returns, all code after the return statement will not be executed as the function will immediately exit

    Function Review:
        Function declaration - Functions that can be used before it's declared
        Function expression - Essentially a funciton stored in a value
        Arrow function - Great for one-line functions. Has no 'this' keyword.

    Function Anatomy:
        function 'function name'('parameter 1', parameter 2', etc...) {
            'function body'
            return 'return expression';
        }
    
    Function Call:
        const 'variable name' = 'function name'('parameter 1', parameter 2', etc...);

    In VSCode, shortcut to move line up/down:
    ALT + up key/down key 
    In VSCode, short to select and move to next occurence:

    In VSCode CTRL + D to selecet all occurences, CTRL + D select first occurence, CTRL + D to create new cursor and move/select onto next occurence

    In VSCode, to move to different splt tab window:
    CTRL + 1/2/3/...
    
    In VSCode, to move current tab to new spl5t tab window:
    CTRL + ALT + right key/right key

    In VSCode, to move cursor to start/end of line:
    CTRL + K, CTRL + S: Edit cursorLineStart/cursorLineEnd
    Removed page lines scrolling, remapped to:
    CTRL + up arrow/down arrow


L39 Introduction to Arrays
    Data structures that are like big containers where we can store variables/values, and then return it

    Two most important data structures in JavaScript are:
        Arrays
        Objects

    Arrays store values, also referred to as elements, in order

    Two ways to create an array:
        Array Literal Syntax/"Brackets":
        const 'array name' = ['value 1', 'value 2', etc..]

        'new' keyword:
        const 'array name' = new Array('value 1', 'value 2', etc..)

    Array index/positions start from 0

    We can get the length of an array using .length property (of array objects)

    Inside the brackets, we can put in any expression but not statements

    Arrays are mutable (in values and size)

    'const' makes only primitive values immutable, not data structures due to how JS stores things in memory; however, we cannot reassign a new array to a const variable

    Arrays can hold values of different types, and also hold other arrays

    In the developer console, you can expand an array to see additional details

    Adding/+ to an array does type coercian to the array, turning it into a  string with all the array values in 'value1, value2, etc..' format before concatenation

    Other mathematical operations on an array will return 'NaN'


L40 Basic Array Operations (Methods)
    JS has some built-in functions that apply to arrays, and these array operations are called methods

    .push() is a method that appends a new value to the end of array, and returns the length of the new array

    .unshift() is a method that prepends a new value to the start of array, and returns the length of the new array

    .pop() is a method that removes the last value from the end of array, and returns the popped value
    
    .shift() is a method that removes the first value from the start of array, and returns the shifted value

    .indexOf() is a method that returns the index of the passed element we want to reference, and returns -1 if not found

    .includes() is an ES7/ES2016 method that returns true if the passed element is in the array, and false if not; this method uses strict equality


L42 Introduction to Objects
    Using multiple lines in data structure declaration is good for seeing the overview of the structure and cleaner code

    In arrays, there is no way to reference elements by name, only by their index number

    Objects define key/value pairs

    New Objects are declared using '{}', which is different from the curly braces used to define code blocks in if / else, switch, function body statements

    const 'variable name' = {
        'propery 1' : 'value 1',
        'property 2' : 'value 2',
        etc..
    }

    Each of the keys are also called properties

    To create an object:
        Object Literal Syntax/"Curly Braces":
        const 'object name' = {'value 1', 'value 2', etc..}

        'new' keyword:
        const 'array name' = new Array('value 1', 'value 2', etc..)

    The big difference between objects and array is that in objects, the order of the properties does not matter but in arrays, the order of elements does matter


L43 Dot vs. Bracket Notation
    Two ways to retrieve values from objects:
        Dot Notation:
            'object name'.'property name'

        Bracket Notation:
            'object name'[" 'property name' "]
    
    '.' is an operator that will go to the specified object, and in this case, retrieve from the specified property

    The big difference in the two notations is that with bracket notation, we can put any expression we like as long as it computes to appropriate proprty string

    Use the dot notation which is cleaner when expressions does not need to be calculated for the property name

    Accessing an undefined property returns 'undefined'

    To add new properties to the object:
        Dot Notation:
        'object name'.'property name' = 'value'

        Bracket Notation:
        'object name'[" 'property name' "] = 'value'

        Going back to operator precdence, Member Access/'.' and Computer Member Access/'[]' have really high priority, just below Grouping/'()'


L44 Object Methods
    Objects can hold any values, including arrays and other objects

    Functions (expressions) are just another type of value, so we can create key:value pairs where values are functions

    Any function attached to an object is called a method; methods are actually properties holding a function value

    Function declaration/statements do not work in objects

    In JS, every method has a access to a special variable called 'this'; This is equaivalent to the object calling the method

    In VSCode, shortcut to multi-line comment:
    SHIFT + ALT + A

    Can also reference the object by name, but it violates the DRY principle (ie. changing the object name means having to change object references)

    Can use the object methods to calculate and store the result in a new/existing property

    Arrow function expression access global object; can't be used to access object properties

    Arrays are actually special objects that have built-in methods


L45 Coding Challenge #3
    Calling object methods without '()' returns the entire function in string as a value

    Object properties cannot be initially defined using other properties as properties are not intialized/are undefined


L46 Iteration: The for Loop
    Control Strucutres:
        Conditionals: if/else statements, case statements, conditional ternary operator
        Loops: for loop, while loop

    for loop is a loop with a counter that continues looping while the loop condition is true

    for Loop Anatomy:
    for('counter declaration'; 'loop condition'; 'counter increment') {
        "loop body"
    } 

    for (let counter = 0; counter <= 10; counter increment/decrement) {
        "loop body"
    }


L47 Looping Arrays, Breaking and Continuing
    'i' is generally used counter name

    Dynamically calculate array length to use as loop condition to adhere to DRY principle

    Iteration is useful either reading or modifying arrays

    'continue' is to exit the current iteration of the loop and continue to the next one

    'break' is used to completely terminate the whole loop


L48 Looping Backwards and Loops in Loops
    You can loop backwards by setting the counter to the length of the object and decrementing the counter

    You can nest loops; inner loops can access variables from outer loops


L49 The while Loop
    The while loop can only specify a condition; more versatile than the for loop as all it needs is a condition that dooes not have to be associated with a counter

    while Loop Anatomy:
    while ('loop condition') {
        "loop body"
    }

    while (true) {
        "loop body"
    }

    Infinite loops will crash the browser

    while loop is for when you do not know how many iterations the loop will have; otherwise use the for loop
