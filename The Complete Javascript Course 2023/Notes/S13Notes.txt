L185 How the DOM Really Works
    DOM is the interface between JS code and HTML documents rendered in the web browser:
        1. Allows us to make JS interact with the browser
        2. We can write JS to:
         - create, modify, and delete HTML elements
         - set styles, classes, and attributes - listen and respond to events
        3. DOM tree is generated from an HTML document, which we can then interact with
        4. DOM is a very complex API that contains lots of methods and properties to interact with the DOM tree
    
    All these DOM methods and properties are organized into these different types of JS objects called "Node":
        Node properties and methods:
            1. Node.textContent / Node.value
            2. Node.childNdoes
            3. Node.parentNode
            4. Node.cloneNode()

        Node type has a couple of "child" types:
            1. Element / HTMLElement (e.g. <P>Paragraph<P>):
                Element type properties and methods:
                    1. Element.innerHTML
                    2. Element.classList
                    3. Element.children
                    4. Element.parentElement
                    5. Element.append()
                    6. Element.remove()
                    7. Element.insertAdjacentHTML()
                    8. Element.querySelector()
                    9. Element.closest()
                    10. Element.matches()
                    11. Element.scrollIntoView()
                    12. Element.setAttribute()

                Element Node also has "child" types, one different type of HTMLElement per HTML element (e.g. HTMLButtonElement, HTMLDivElement, etc...)
            2. Text (e.g. <p>PARAGRAPH<p>)
            3. Comment (e.g. <!--COMMENT-->)
            4. Document
                Document type properties and methods:
                    1. Document.querySelector()
                    2. Document.createElement()
                    3. Document.getElementById()

    Node and Window types are also a "child" type of EventTarget:
        EventTarget properties and methods:
            1. EventTarger.addEventListener()
            2. EventTarger.removeEventListener()

        Window type is a Global object that has lots of methods and properties, many unrelated to DOM

    We do not manually create these types, as they happened automatically behind the scenes

    Inheritance of Methods and Properties:
        All the child types will have access to the properties and methods of all their parent node types


L186 Selecting, Creating, and Deleting Elements
    'document' is not the real DOM element, and need to select the actual document element

    document selector properties:
        1. document.documentElement
        2. document.head
        3. document.body

    document selector methods:
        1. document.querySelector(''/./#'selector name') (returns Node)
        2. document.querySelectorAll(''/./#'selector name') (returns NodeList) 
        3. document.getElementId('element ID')
        4. document.getElementsByTagName('element tag') (returns HTMLCollection):
            HTMLCollection is different from NodeList:
                - HTMLCollection is a "live" connection meaning that if the DOM changes, then this collection is also immediately updated
        5. document.getElementsByClassName('class name')
