L170 Converting and Checking Numbers
    In JS, all Numbers (primitives) are representeed internally as floating point numbers, 64 base 2 format

    Since everything is representing in binary base 2, it is difficult to represent certain fractions even with JS roundings behind the scenes

    Cannot do really precise scientific or financial calculations in JS, so do NOT compare floating points normally

    Number() and '+"number"' is the shorthand way to type coerce strings to numbers (similar to concatenate an empty string to a number for quick string type coercion)

    Number.parseInt('string', 'regex') is a function to parse a string into a number:
    Number.parseFloat('string', 'regex') is a function to pase a string into a floating point number:
        Number has to be at the START of the string otherwise it fails (parseFloat() additionally parse number after '.')

        Failed parsing returns NaN

        'regex' value specifies base numeral system (ex. 10), and defaults to base 10 when not specified
        
        Useful for extract CSS values from units

    The Number functions are also global functions that can be called without 'Number.', but it is now encouraged in modern JS to call the functions with 'Number.' since it provides a (Number) namespace for these functions

    Number.isNaN('input') is a Number namespace function that checks if the input is NaN

    Number.isFinite('input') is a Number namespace function that checks if the input is a number AND finite

    Number.isInteger('input') is a Numeber namespace function that checks if the input is an integer:
        An floating point with '.0' is also an integer
        
    Converting an invalid string to a number returns NaN 

    Dividing a number by 0 returns 'Infinity', which is still a number 


L171 Math and Rounding
    Math namespace functions does type coercion BUT NOT parsing

    Math.sqrt('number') is Math namespace function that calculates squareroot:
        equivalent to ** (1/2)

    Math.max('array') is a Math namepsace function that returns the maximum number from that array:

    Math.min('array') is a Math namepsace function that returns the minimum number from that array:
        Returns NaN or Infinity if it exists

    Math.PI is a Math namespace constant representing pi

    Math.random() is a Math namespace function that returns a number between [0,1)

    Math.trunc() is a Math namespace function that truncates the decimal portion of floating points

    Math.round() is a Math namespace function that rounds to the nearest integer

    Math.ceil() is a Math namespace function that rounds up

    Math.floor() is a Math namespace function that rounds down (works better than .trunc() for negative numbers)

    'number'.toFixed('decimal place') is a Number method that returns a STRING of the number rounded to the specified decimal place:
        Remember primitive types do not have methods so JS will use boxing to convert this to a Number Obj in the background to call the method


L172 The Remainder Operator
    '%' is the remainder / "modulo" operator that gives the remainder after dividing the lefthand with the righthand number:
        Common usecase is to determine if a number is even if the remainder is 0 ('number' % 2 === 0)


L173 Numeric Separators
    Numeric Separators (ES2021/ES12) format numbers so they are more readable:
        Use '_' between number digits to separate them visually (similar to ',')

        Cannot place them at the start AND end of numbers OR period, and can't place multiple in a row

        Does not affect the value of the number so can type convert into strings

        ex.) 1_000_000 similar to 1,000,000

    '_' does not register as a numeric separator when type convert/coerce strings into numbers (will be treated as a string character) so be careful


L174 Working with BigInt
    Remember Numbers primitives are represented internally as 64 bits, but only 53 bits are used to store the actual digits while 11 bits are used for storing the position of the decimal point and sizing:
        Number.MAX_SAFE_INTGER === (2 ^ 53) - 1 is the largest number possible (9_007_199_254_740_991)

        Past this number, JS cannot accurately represent unsafe number and loses preicion

        This happens with really large database IDs or 60 bit numbers used in other programming languages

    BigInt primitive type (ES2020/ES11) allows JS to represent really large numbers:
        Two ways:
            'big integer''n'

            BigInt('big integer')
                The 'big integer' is still processed before being used to construct BigInt so pass it as a STRING to prevent this

    You can use BigInt with the other operators normally EXCEPT:
        1. You CANNOT perform mathematical operations between BigInt and other Numbers, or Math namespace function

        2. Comparison or equality operators are ALLOWED since BigInt will be type coerced to Number

        3. String concatenation is ALLOWED since BigInt will be type coerced to String

        4. Division between BigInts will always give a TRUNCATED BigInt value


L175 Creating Dates
    new Date() constructor function is used to create Date objects:
        String formats:
            "'Day of Week' 'Month' 'Day' 'Year' 'Time' 'Timezone' 'DST'"

            "'Date'-'Month'-'Day'T'Hour':'Min':'Second'.'Millisecond''Time Zone Symbol'"
        
        1. new Date ():
            By default, no arguments gets the current date

        2. new Date ('date and time string'):
            A properly formatted string returns that date and time 
            
            Although JS can parse incomplete / misordered strings, it is unreliable and not recommended

        3. new Date('year', 'month', 'day', 'hour', 'second', 'milliseconds')
            The 'month' starts from 0 so, 0 is Jan, 1 is Feb, etc...

        4. new Date(0):
            Gives the Unix Epoch which is when time starts for Unix systems (Thu Jan 1 1970 0:00:00 GMT+0000(UTC)

        5. new Date('day' * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000):
            Multiplying the 'day' * 24h/day * 60m/h * 60s/m * 1000ms/s gives us the number called the "timestamp"

    Date methods:
    Change "get" to "set" to set the number instead
        .getFullYear() gets the full number year

        .getYear() gets the number year since 1900

        .getMonth() gets the number month (STARTING from 0 to 11)

        .getDate() gets the number day

        .getDay() gets the number day of the week (0: Sunday, ..., 6: Saturday)

        .getHours() gets the number hour

        .getMinutes() gets the number minutes

        .getSeconds() gets the number seconds

        .getTime() gets the number timestamp for that date
        
        .now() gets the number timestamp for the current time and date

        .toISOString() converts to the date to international standard formatted string (ex. 2037-11-19T20:23:00.000Z)
