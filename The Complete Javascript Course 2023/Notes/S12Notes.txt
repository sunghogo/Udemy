L170 Converting and Checking Numbers
    In JS, all Numbers (primitives) are representeed internally as floating point numbers, 64 base 2 format

    Since everything is representing in binary base 2, it is difficult to represent certain fractions even with JS roundings behind the scenes

    Cannot do really precise scientific or financial calculations in JS, so do NOT compare floating points normally

    Number() and '+"number"' is the shorthand way to type coerce strings to numbers (similar to concatenate an empty string to a number for quick string type coercion)

    Number.parseInt('string', 'regex') is a function to parse a string into a number:
    Number.parseFloat('string', 'regex') is a function to pase a string into a floating point number:
        Number has to be at the START of the string otherwise it fails (parseFloat() additionally parse number after '.')

        Failed parsing returns NaN

        'regex' value specifies base numeral system (ex. 10), and defaults to base 10 when not specified
        
        Useful for extract CSS values from units

    The Number functions are also global functions that can be called without 'Number.', but it is now encouraged in modern JS to call the functions with 'Number.' since it provides a (Number) namespace for these functions

    Number.isNaN('input') is a Number namespace function that checks if the input is NaN

    Number.isFinite('input') is a Number namespace function that checks if the input is a number AND finite

    Number.isInteger('input') is a Numeber namespace function that checks if the input is an integer:
        An floating point with '.0' is also an integer
        
    Converting an invalid string to a number returns NaN 

    Dividing a number by 0 returns 'Infinity', which is still a number 


L171 Math and Rounding
    Math namespace functions does type coercion BUT NOT parsing

    Math.sqrt('number') is Math namespace function that calculates squareroot:
        equivalent to ** (1/2)

    Math.max('array') is a Math namepsace function that returns the maximum number from that array:

    Math.min('array') is a Math namepsace function that returns the minimum number from that array:
        Returns NaN or Infinity if it exists

    Math.PI is a Math namespace constant representing pi

    Math.random() is a Math namespace function that returns a number between [0,1)

    Math.trunc() is a Math namespace function that truncates the decimal portion of floating points

    Math.round() is a Math namespace function that rounds to the nearest integer

    Math.ceil() is a Math namespace function that rounds up

    Math.floor() is a Math namespace function that rounds down (works better than .trunc() for negative numbers)

    'number'.toFixed('decimal place') is a Number method that returns a STRING of the number rounded to the specified decimal place:
        Remember primitive types do not have methods so JS will use boxing to convert this to a Number Obj in the background to call the method
