JavaScript Fundamentals - Part 1
L7 Hello World!
    Install Chrome and open Developer Console
    Can compile and execute JS code from the browser

L8 A Brief Introduction to JavaScript
    JavaScript versions are ES# (ECMAScript)
        Modern JS is ES6(2015)-ES11(2020)

L9 Linking a JavaScrip File
    ';' at the end as delimiter is not necessary but good practice

    Ctrl + B in VSCode to get rid of side popout

    Linking to <script src=""></script> is usually at the end of the html body tag

L10 Values and Variables
    Variables store literal values

    Great for managing and retrieving values

    Camelcase is common in JS, snakecase in Ruby and etc.

    JS variables cannot start with a number; variable names can only contain letters, numbers, underscores, or dollar sign

    JS variables also cannot be exactly named after reserved keywords like 'new' or 'function'; They can be named after nonreserverd keywords like 'name' but not good practice

    JS variables also should not begin with upper case for convention

    JS Variables that are all in uppercase are reserved for constants like 'PI'

    JS Variable names should be descriptive for cleaner code
