L142 Simple Array Methods
    Methods are simply functions we can call on objects / that are attached to objects

    .slice('start index', 'end index') array method extracts and returns a new ARRAY containing that slice WITHOUT mutating the original array:
        The end parameter does not have to be specified

        The end paramter is NOT included 

        A negative number as the start extracts that number of elements starting from the end

        A negative number as the end parameter extracts from the start index to the end excluding the specified number of elements

        Can also not pass any parameters to create a shallow copy of the array

    .splice('start index', 'delete count') array method extracts and returns a new ARRAY containing that slice while MUTATING the original array:
        The original array will contain the leftovers

        Most used case is to .splice(-1) to get rid of the last element

    .reverse() array method reverses and MUTATES the original array

    .concat('array 2') method concatenates two arrays into a single array WITHOUT mutating the original arrays

    .join('separator substring') returns a string that contains the contents of the array that has its commas replaced by the separator substring
        No argument defaults to commas without whitespace (',')

    From  from previous sections:
        .push(), 
        .pop(), 
        .unshift(), 
        .shift(), 
        .indexOf(), 
        .includes()


L143 The new at Method
    .at('index paramter') (ES2022) string/array method lets us access array elements as an alternative to bracket notation:
        If the index paramter is a negative parameter, it starts accessing from the end of the array

        Also useful for method chaining


L144 Looping Arrays: forEach
    So far, you can use for/while and for-of loops to iterate through arrays

    .forEach('callback function'('current element', 'current index', 'entire array')) array method (ES5/ES2009) is a higher-order function that requires a callback function:
        The current element in each iteration is passed as an argument to the callback function

        The index is passed as the second paramenter, and the entire array is passed as the third paramter (ORDER matters)

    Important differences between for/for-of and .forEach():
        .forEach() CANNOT use break and continue keywords, for loops can

        .forEach() can be slightly cleaner and easier to utilize


L145 forEach With Maps and Sets
    .forEach('callback function'('value', 'key', 'map')) also works with maps and sets (but NOT objects):
        In sets, the keys are the same as the values since sets has no order and has unique values (and developers wanted to keep the syntax consistent) so you can use '_' for the second paramter

    In JS, '_' signifies a throw away variable that is unecessary


L146 PROJECT: "Bankist" App


L147 Creating DOM Elements
    It is not good practice to start writing code in the global context, better to encapsulate it inside a function

    Also, should pass data into a function instead of having the function work with a global variable
    
    Template literals are great for making html template strings

    .insertAdjacentHTML("'position'", 'html string') is a DOM menthod that inserts HTML string after the specified position:
        'beforebegin' - outside above the element opening tag
        'afterbegin' - inside right after the element opening tag 
        'beforeend' - inside right before element end tag
        'afterend' - outside right below element end tag
    
    .innerHTML is a DOM property that returns the entire HTML including the tags
    
    .textContent is a DOM property that returns only the text contained inside the HTML


L148 Coding Challenge #1


L149 Data Transformations: map, filter, reduce
    3 important data transformation array methods (ES5/ES2009):
        1. .map() - Returns a NEW array containing the results of applying an operation on all original array elements

        2. .filter() - Returns a NEW array containing the array elements that passed a specifed test condition

        3. .reduce() - Reduces all array elements down to one single "reduced" value (e.g. adding all elements together)


L150 The map Method
    'array name'.map(function('current element', 'current index', 'array') { "callback function body returns value" })

    Using array methods to solve problems (e.g. .map() to transform each eleemnt) is in more line with functional programming paradigm

    In modern JS, there is a push for functional programming

    Using arrow functions for small callback functions leads to smaller, cleaner code but people argue that the lack of function and return keyword leads to back readability

    When we iterate through the array and perform some action (e.g. console.log()), these are called 'side effects'. However with the array methods, all we do is return a new array, that we can then perform actions on (e.g. console.log()), thus having no side effects.
    This is an important concept in functional programming.


L151 Computing Usernames
    To repeat a previous important point, functions should receive the data it should work with instead of using a global variable

    If we just want to transform/mutate an object, then there is no need to return anything and will just have to iterate and mutate as a side effect


L152 The filter Method
    `array name`.filter(function('current element', 'current index', 'array') { "callback function body returns BOOLEAN value" })

    Keeps the elements that returns 'true' in the callback function

    We use the transformation array methods for more functional code, as well as for chaining arrays


L153 The reduce Method
    'array name'.reduce( function('accumulator', 'current element', 'current index', 'array') { "callback function body returns new ACCUMULATOR value }, 'initial accumulator value')

    The accumulator snowball effects; Can be any action as long as we reduce the array into a single value

    Without .reduce() transformation array methods, we would have to rely on an external accumulator variable which does not lead to functional code

    Once again, callback arrow functions can compant and clean up the .reduce() method call


L154 Coding Challenge #2
    .forEach() and other array iterations IS AFFECTED by array mutation side-effects (e.g. splice)


L155 The Magic of Chaining Methods
    Method chaining can be thought as a pipeline that processes our data

    However, it can be difficult to debug if any of the steps messes up; Can log the array parameter to check the data as it transforms

    Do not overuse chaining, since chaining tons of methods can cause performance issues for huge arrays; Look for wys to optimize the chaining

    It is bad practice in JS to chain methods that mutate the underlying original array, such as .splice() and .reverse()


L156 Coding Challenge #3


L157 The find Method
    .find() array method (ES6/ES2015) can be used to retrieve one element from an array based on a condition:
        Does not return a new array but the FIRST element that satisfies the condition

        If the element does not exist, returns undefined

    'array name'.find(function('current elemnet', 'current index', 'array') { "callback function body that returns a BOOLEAN value})

    The main difference between .filter() vs .find():
        1. .filter() returns all the elements that match the condition while .find() only returns the first one

        2. .filter() returns a new array while .find() returns only the element itself


L158 Implementing Login
    For a button element within an form element, the default behavior is for the button send the POST request and then reload the page

    If you remember, the callback function for the event handler is passed the event object as the first parameter that contains information regarding the event:
        'selector'.addEventListener('event', function('event object') { "callback function body" } )
    
    'event object'.preventDefault() event object method prevents the default behavior for that event

    Remember we can use optional chaining with '?' to check if objects exist before 

    Remember you can assign multiple variables using '=' to chain the assignment:
        'var 1' = 'var 2' = ...etc. = 'value'

    'selector'.blur() selector method blurs out the cursor hover


L159 Implementing Transfers
    Standard practice to disable default form behavior using .preventDefault() event object method


L160 The findIndex Method
    .findIndex() array method (ES6/ES2015) can be used to retrieve the index of the first matching element in the array:
        Does not return a new array but the INDEX of the FIRST element that satisfies the condition

        If the element does not exist, returns -1

    'array name'.findIndex(function('current elemnet', 'current index', 'array') { "callback function body that returns a BOOLEAN value})

    The main difference between .findIndex() vs .indexOf():
     For .indexOf() we can only search for a value that is in the array while for .findIndex(), we can specify a more complex condition in the callback function 


L161 some and every
    .some() array method (ES5/ES2009) iterates through the array, and returns true if ANY element matches the conditional callback function, or false otherwise

    .every() array method (ES5/ES2009) iterates through the array, and returns true if EVERY element matches the conditional callback function, or false otherwise

    'array name'.some(function('current elemnet', 'current index', 'array') { "callback function body that returns a BOOLEAN value})

    'array name'.every(function('current elemnet', 'current index', 'array') { "callback function body that returns a BOOLEAN value})

    The main difference between .some() vs .includes():
        For .includes() method (ES7/2016) only tests for value equality, while .some() method can specify a more complex condition in the callback function

    For cleaner code, we can separate our callback function into a variable for reuse


L162 flat and flatMap
    .flat('depth') array method (ES10/ES2019) "flattens" or removes nesting from an array:
        .flat('depth') only goes 1 level deep by default, and does not flatten deeply nested array unless specifed by 'depth'

    .flattMap() array method (ES10/ES2019)performs .map() first, then .flat(), but flattens only 1 level deep
        .flatMap(function('current element', 'current index', 'array'))


L163 Sorting Arrays
    .sort() array method sorts the array alphabetically AS STRINGS by default, and MUTATES the original array:
        .sort(function('element 1', 'element 2') { "return < 0 (ex. -1) to KEEP order, return > 1 (ex 1) to SWITCH order"})

        So returning a NEGATIVE number KEEPS the order the same, while returning a POSITIVE number SWITCHES the order 

        For arrays with mixed data types, do NOT use .sort()

    Remember, you can use .slice() method to create a copy of an array while method chaining


L164 More Ways of Creating and Filling Arrays
    When we have the data, we can create arrays with the passed data using bracket literal or the Array constructor

    new Array() constructor method:
        1. new Array('size') creates a new EMPTY array of that size

        2. new Array('element 1', 'element 2', etc...) creates a new FILLED array with passed arguments

    Using .map() to fill an EMPTY array does NOT work

    .fill() array method (ES6/ES2015) fills an array with the specified data and MUTATES the original array:
        .fill('fill data', 'starting index', 'end index')

        .fill works on both EMPTY and FILLED arrays

        Index specification works similar to the .slice() array methods

    Array.from() constructor method (ES6/ES2015) can also be used to construct array programmatically:
        Array.from({length: 'specified length'}, 'mapping function')

        Array.from('array like structure', 'mapping function')

        Can also be used to construct array from array-like structures such Iterables like Strings, Sets, Maps OR NodeLists commonly returned from .querySelectorAll():
            Remember you can also convert them into an array using the spread operator


L165 Summary: Which Array Method to Use?
    Which array method to use?

    To mutate original array
        1. Add to original:
            .push(), .unshift()
        2. Remove from original:
            .pop(), .shift(), .splice()
        3. Others:
            .reverse(), .sort(), .fill()
    
    (Create) A new array
        1. Computed from original:
            .map()
        2. Filtered using condition:
            .filter()
        3. Portion of original:
            .slice()
        4. Adding original to other:
            .concat()
        5. Flattening the original:
            .flat(), .flatMap()
    
    (Find) An array index
        1. Based on value:
            .indexOf()
        2. Based on test condition:
            .findIndex()

    (Find) An array element: 
        1. Based on test condition
            .find()

    Know if array includes
        1. Based on value:
            .includes()
        2. Based on test condition:
            .some(), .every()

    A new string
        1. Based on separator string:
            .join()

    To transform a value
        1. Based on accumulator:
            .reduce()
            (Boil down array to a single value of any type: number, string, boolean, or even new array or object)
    
    To just loop an array
        1. Based on callback:
            .forEach()
            (Does not create a new array, just loops over it)


L166 Array Methods Practice
    'number'++ returns the OLD value while the prefixed ++'number' returns the NEW incremented value

    .reduce() method is extremely versatile as you can set the accumulator to anything like an object AS LONG as you return the new accumulator
