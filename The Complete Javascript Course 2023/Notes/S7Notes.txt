L70 PROJECT #1: Guess My Number!
    We can select elements in JS just like in CSS:
        document.querySelector('./#/ / selector');

    To get the text content instead of the entire HTML element, use '.textContent' method after selector:
        document.querySelector('selector').textContent;


L71 What's the DOM and DOM Manipulation
    DOM - Document Object Model:
        Structured represenation of HTML documents. Allows JS to acces HTML elements and styles to manipulate them.

    DOM is a connection point betweem HTML documents and JavasSript; DOM specification ensures the same functionality across different browsers

    DOM is automatically generated as soon as HTML loads, and is stored in a tree structure containing each HTML element

    Parent elemet, child element, sibling element terms used to refer to the nodes and their relationships

    DOM always starts with the special 'Document' object at the very top

    DOM -> <html> element -> <head> and <body> element -> etc..

    DOM Methods and Properties for DOM Manipulation IS NOT a part of JS; Instead they are part of the Web APIs (timers, fetch API, etc.) which can interact with JS


L72 Selecting and Manipulating Elements
    You can assign new values to '.querySelector()' and '.textContent' using JS '='

    Use .'value' to get the value (of input)

    Once again, in VS Code, to move a line up or down, use ALT + UP/DOWN
