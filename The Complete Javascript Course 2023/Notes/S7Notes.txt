L70 PROJECT #1: Guess My Number!
    We can select elements in JS just like in CSS:
        document.querySelector('./#/ / selector');

    To get the text content instead of the entire HTML element, use '.textContent' method after selector:
        document.querySelector('selector').textContent;


L71 What's the DOM and DOM Manipulation
    DOM - Document Object Model:
        Structured represenation of HTML documents. Allows JS to acces HTML elements and styles to manipulate them.

    DOM is a connection point betweem HTML documents and JavasSript; DOM specification ensures the same functionality across different browsers

    DOM is automatically generated as soon as HTML loads, and is stored in a tree structure containing each HTML element

    Parent elemet, child element, sibling element terms used to refer to the nodes and their relationships

    DOM always starts with the special 'Document' object at the very top

    DOM -> <html> element -> <head> and <body> element -> etc..

    DOM Methods and Properties for DOM Manipulation IS NOT a part of JS; Instead they are part of the Web APIs (timers, fetch API, etc.) which can interact with JS


L72 Selecting and Manipulating Elements
    You can assign new values to '.querySelector()' and '.textContent' using JS '='

    Use .'value' to get the value (of input)

    Once again, in VS Code, to move a line up or down, use ALT + UP/DOWN


L73 Handling Click Events
    An event is something that happens on the page

    Add event listeners to wait for certain events to happen and then react to it using:
        '.addEventListener('type/name of event', 'function expression')'

    The event handler is a function that is executed in reaction to an event; The JS engine will run the function even though it is not called anywhere in the script

    Usually when we get something from the user interface, it usually in 'string'

    For input fields, check for cases when there are no inputs; In this case for 'input type="number"', an empty field defaults to 0 so it is a falsy value


L74 Implementing the Game Logic
    Math is an object that JS gives us:
        Math.random() gives us a value from 0 to 1
        Math.trunc() gives us a truncated/rounded value

    Save data from the DOM that will be often manipulated in a variable in code

    Application state and state variables which are relevant to the application


L75 Manipulating CSS Styles
    DOM also incluse CSS styles

    To select and change CSS style use '.style.'name of property'' method and then assign the string value:
        The properties will be converted to camel case instead of use '-'

    This styles are set as inline styles so will have precedence over internal & external CSS
