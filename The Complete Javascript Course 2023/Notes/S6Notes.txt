L64 Basic HTML Structure and Elements
    HTML - Hypertext Markup Language:
        Used to describe the content of webpages
    
    HTML document is made up of elements:
            <html>: main element enclosing the document
            <head>: contains the settings for the website
                <title>: the name of our website
            <body>: contains the visible elements of the webstie
                <h1>, ... , <h6>: describe headings lvl 1-6
                <p>: describe a paragraph
    
    Body elements have some sort of formatting

    HTML VS Code Extensions:
        Auto Close Tags
        Auto Rename Tags

    VS Code HTML Boilerplate shortcut:
        '!' +  TAB


L65 Attributes, Classes and IDs
    Some elements can have attributes that describe elements

    You can nest elements in another as child elements

    HTML elements/attributes:
        <a>: anchor element
        <a href="">: hypertext reference attribute
        <img>: image element, no closing tag since there is no additional content
        <img src="">: source attribute
        <div>: generic box element
        <input>: input element, no closing tag
        <input type="">: input type attribute
        <input placeholder="">: input placeholder attribute
        <button>: button element
        <form>: special form element


    Inline elements falls in line with the rest of the text: <a>, <img>
    Block elements are not in line with the previous element: <h1> ... <h6>, <p>

    Class vs ID:
        Classes and ID are crucial for identifying elements

        The main difference between classes and IDs are that IDs have to be unique to one element

        Class attribute:
            <element class="class name">
        
        ID attribute:
            <element id="id name">

        In usages, classes are mostly used while IDs are only rarely used as it is better practice

    Best way to make boxes in HTML is use <div>

    The convention in HTML and CSS is to sepearate words with a '-'

    Semantic HTML is the idea of using the appropriate element according to the content in it


L66 Basic Styling with CSS
    CSS - Cascading Style Sheets:
        Used to style HTML

    <style> element goes in the <head> section to specify internal CSS

    Different ways to style using CSS:
        1. Element Selector - specify HTML elements
            element {}
        2. Class Selector - specify classes
            .class {}
        3. ID Selector - specify IDs
            #id {}

    Create objects using selectors, and specify styling properties

    CSS Properties:
        background-color: specify background color
        font-family: specify font family
        color: specify text color
        border: specify border settings

    CSS is usually in an external file; Need to link the file in <head> section:
        <link href="css file name" rel="stylehseet">

    Some CSS properties are inherited by child elements, like font-family and font-size 


L67 Introduction to the CSS Box Model
    The Box Model fundamentally defines how elements are displayed on a page and how they are sized

    The Box Model shows that each element has 4 sizes:
        1. Margin:
            space outside the box / between boxes
        2. Border:
            goes around the padding and the content
        3. Padding:
            transparent area around the content, inside the box
        4. Content Height x Width:
            text, images, etc.
    
    Fill Area:
        area that gets filled with background color or images - includes content, padding, border

    Global Reset to remove the default margins and paddings applied automatically to some elements:
        Use the '*' selector to select all elements

        * {
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
            box-sizing: border-box;
        }

        box-sizing: border-box; sets the dimensions of the box to include/account for borders and padding

    CSS Units:
        px, %, em, rem  

    You can add padding, margins, borders to specific sides of the box model

    Use Chrome Dev Tools and Elements tab / Inspector tool to see the box model of each element easily

    Can specify multiple selectors using a comma in between 

    Child Selectors:
        'parent selector' 'child selector' {}
