L65 Attributes, Classes and IDs
    Some elements can have attributes that describe elements

    You can nest elements in another as child elements

    HTML elements/attributes:
        <a>: anchor element
        <a href="">: hypertext reference attribute
        <img>: image element, no closing tag since there is no additional content
        <img src="">: source attribute
        <div>: generic box element
        <input>: input element, no closing tag
        <input type="">: input type attribute
        <input placeholder="">: input placeholder attribute
        <button>: button element
        <form>: special form element


    Inline elements falls in line with the rest of the text: <a>, <img>
    Block elements are not in line with the previous element: <h1> ... <h6>, <p>

    Class vs ID:
        Classes and ID are crucial for identifying elements

        The main difference between classes and IDs are that IDs have to be unique to one element

        Class attribute:
            <element class="class name">
        
        ID attribute:
            <element id="id name">

        In usages, classes are mostly used while IDs are only rarely used as it is better practice

    Best way to make boxes in HTML is use <div>

    The convention in HTML and CSS is to sepearate words with a '-'

    Semantic HTML is the idea of using the appropriate element according to the content in it
