L89 An High-Level Overview of JavaScript
    JavaScript is a high-level, prototype-based, object-oriented, multi-paradigm, interpreted or just-in-time compiled, dynamic, single threaded, garbage-collected programming language with first-class functions and a non-blocking event loop concurrency model

    Topics:
        High-level:
            Low-Level = Developer has to manage resources manually

            High-level = Developer does NOT have to worry, everything happens automatically thanks to abstraction

            Low level languages like C can always be optimized better thanks to direct resource management

        Garbage-collected:
            Garbage collection is an algorithm that cleans old unused memory so we don't have to

        Interpreted or just-in-time compiled:
            Computer only understands binary/machine code

            Human-readable JS code is an abstraction over 0s and 1s

            Compilation - Conversion to machine code, which happens inside the JS engine

        Multi-paradigm:
            Paradigm - An approach and mindset of structuring code, which will direct your coding style

            1. Procedural programming - Code is organized in a linear way
            2. Object-oriented programming (OOP)
            3. Functional programming (FP)

            Imperative vs Declarative

        Proto-based object-orientated:
            Almost everything in JS are objects (other than primitive data types)
        First-class functions
        Dynamically
        Single-threaded
        Non-blocking event loop
