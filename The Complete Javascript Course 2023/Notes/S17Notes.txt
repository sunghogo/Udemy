L270 An Overview of Modern JavaScript Development
    Modern JavaScript Development:
        Development: 
            We now divide our project into multple modules to make our project more organized and maintainable
            
            Can include 3rd-party modules

            Node Package Manager(NPM):
                Originally developed for Node.js, but is now the go to repository for all kinds of packages in modern JS development 
 
                Contains open-source packages to include 3rd-party code in our own code (e.g React, jQuery, Leaflet, etc.)

                NPM is both repository in which packages lives, and the program we use on the computer to install and manage these packages

        Build Process:
            One big JS bundle is built which will deployed to the web server for production

            Bundling - Joins all the modules into one file:
                Important for two reasons:
                    1. Older browsers don't support modules
                    2. Better for performance to send less files, and bundling step compresses the code

            Transpiling/Polyfilling - Convert modern JS back to ES5:
                Transpiling - Converts code writtern in (newer) ES versions to other (older) ones

                Polyfilling - Implements features in JS that is unavailable in the current JS environment; Commonly used for features that can't be transpiled

                Usually done using a tool called Babel

            We don't do the build process ourselves, and use build tools:
                Webpack and Parcel are the common "JS Bundlers" developer tools:
                    Webpack is the more popular one but can be more configuration intensive

                    Parcel is 0 configuration and requires no setup code

                These development tools are also on NPM

        Production: 
            Production means the application is used by real users in the real world
