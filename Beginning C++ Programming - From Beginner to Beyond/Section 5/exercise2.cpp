#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

/*
Using cout and the insertion operator
In this exercise, you will write a statement using cout  and the insertion operator <<  to display how many dogs Sally has.  

The variable x  represents the number of dogs. 

x  has already been declared and initialized for you.

The output should read "Sally has 3 dogs.". 

For this exercise, there is NO need to use the '\n '  character or endl  to create a new line after the output statement.

Note: only a single cout statement is required for this exercise. No other code should be necessary.

You can find my solution by clicking on the solution.txt file on the left pane. But please make sure you give it a go yourself first, and only check the solution if you really get stuck.
