L4 Let's Build an App!
L5 Critical Questions
    JSX is a mixture of HTML elements and JS that React uses to write HTML using JSX functions called "Components":
        1. Component declaration
            function 'Component Name' () {
            return (<div> ... </div>)  
            } 
            
        2. Component call
            <'Component Name' />

Quiz 1: Core Concepts
    1) The primary goals of React are to...
        Show HTML to the user and change that HTML when the user does something
    2) Components are used to tell React what content we want to show on the screen. How is a component created?
        By creating a function that returns JSX
    3) ...
    4) ...


L7 Node Setup
L8 Creating a React Project
    Check node version:
        node -v
    
    Generating a project:
        npx create-react-app 'project name'

    Starting a project:
        cd 'project name'
        npm start

    Development host and port:
        Defaults to https://localhost:3000
        To stop in terminal:
            CTRL + C 

L9 What is Create React App?
    Browser/JS cannot read JSX, need to transpile JSX and Components before running

    Babel - Tool to turn JSX inro normal JS code

    Webpack- Tool to merge all project files into a single file (e.g. bundle.js)

    index.js - Frist file that gets executed when our app runs
    
    index.html - Skeleton for the React App

    package.json, package-lock.json - Lists dependencies our app needs

    nodes-modules - Contains dependencies our app needs

Going foward, diagrams slides/notes will be enough
